# Report

* ### Introduction

  Our team has 3 members, Wenlun Hu (Pitt id: ), Hanlin Ye (Pitt id: ) and  Jun Jiang (Pitt id: juj19). Our project is to develop a Forum. The forum works like a discussion board. Users who login the forum can post text and picture on the forum and they can also leave comments to other users' articles. We also create the role of administrators who have the power to delete users' articles. 

  

* ### Objective

  Our goal can be separated into following parts:

  > * Design the layout and style of the website.
  >
  > * Develop the homepage where can list out all the articles and has the function of pagination.
  >
  > * Develop the sign up and login function.
  >
  > * Implement user posting function and search function.
  >
  > * Implement user comment function.
  >
  > * Implement user profile management function.
  >
  > * Add administrator function.

  Problem solving: when we deployed the project, we used nohup at first. However, nohup was easy to crash at the backend. Then we used pm2 to solve this problem. PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks. Compared to nohup,  PM2 is more stable and not easy to go wronge. In this processing, we compared the performance of using nohup and PM2 and we also learned the capability and functionality of PM2.

  Extra features: Beyond the features listed in the assignment requirements, we also implement the searching function, user profile management function, editing function, like function and comment system, error tolerance mechanism, administrator delete function, administrator statistics function.

  

* ### Team memberâ€™s contributions

  Wenlun Hu: Using Angular framework to develop the frontend webpages.

  Hanlin Ye: Using Express and MongoDB to develop the backend functions. 

  Jun Jiang: Adjusting the outlook by modifying the Css files. Writing documentations.

  

* ### Technical Architecture

  * Models

    Using Mongoose to define data structures and to operate the MongoDB. Using mongoose-unique-validator: for preventing duplicate usernames.

  * Views

    Using Angular to create 3 services and 7 components. The three services are account, topic and info. Account supports 3 components: user info, login and sign up. Topic supports 2 components: comments and topic. Info supports 2 components: daily activeness and admin search which are the components for administrator. The libraries used include angular material and ng2-charts. The tags used include mat-form-field, mat-toolbar, mat-card, mat-tab, mat-chip-list, mat-table, mat-paginator.

  * Controllers

    Implementing RESTful APIs. Using bcrypt for salt hash the password. Using body-parser for getting the json from client side. Using express as the framework of node.js. Using jsonwebtoken for storing the information of accounts and authentication. Using path for keeping the absolute path in node.js. 

    

* ### Challenges





* ### Future Work





* ### Conclusion

  From our perspective, we have learned what we wanted. We think that Angular, Express and MongoDB would be useful in the future iterations because they are useful and powerful when we need a rapid development. And there are many opensource libraries can be used.
